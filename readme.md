# CatHack
An open source external orbwalker for league of legends.
Please note this is not a GOOD orbwalker. This is just a project im working on.
If you want to improve anything from this code, fork my repo and go at it!
Also, CatHack's system to take screenshots is **REALLY** fucking slow. Expect ~30 fps loss or greater.
I am planning on removing it as you can just hardcode your ping into the orbwalking calculation.

# How to use
1. Download the Tessdata folder from the repo
2. Put the Tessdata folder into your C: drive' documents folder. **(IT HAS TO BE IN C:)**
3. Launch CatHack
4. Go into the "Player" tab
5. Click on New Config
6. Open the other window containing the ping screenshot tool, and click the "Take MS Screenshot" button
7. Position the gray box around your ping in league. It should look like this: ![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/4f89b7cd4731f088c20f7ab17ee418a5.png "Picture")
8. After you have successfully positoned the box, press F to save it. Also make sure to choose a keybind for CatHack to orbwalk with. (I recommend X)
9. Go back into the main menu of CatHack, go into orbwalking and toggle it on. 
10. Open up a practice tool game and test it. 

CatHack automatically saves settings, but anytime you close it you need to take the ping screenshot again.
If you have already saved a screenshot, simply go into "Player" tab and click on Use Config and THEN take the picture (you do not need to move the box)

# Todo
- Orbwalker always misses on ping change
- Pixelsearch doesn't properly hover over enemies if they are too close
- Pixelsearch RARELY targets something other than champions
