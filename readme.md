# CatHack
An open source external orbwalker for league of legends.
Please note this is not a GOOD orbwalker. This is just a project im working on.
If you want to improve anything from this code, fork my repo and go at it!
Also, CatHack's system to take screenshots is **REALLY** fucking slow. Expect ~30 fps loss or greater.
I am planning on removing it as you can just hardcode your ping into the orbwalking calculation.

# How to use

# Usage remarks
CatHack automatically saves settings, but anytime you close it you need to take the ping screenshot again.
If you have already saved a screenshot, simply go into "Player" tab and click on Use Config and THEN take the picture (you do not need to reposition the box).
After, open every other tab (orbwalk and champions), close them, and then you are good to go!

If you play league on 1920x1080, use the userData.txt file from the repo. It has the perfect position for ping (assuming you only have 2 digit ping)
Place the text file in your documents folder, just like tessdata should be.

**I am not going to help you with compiling. Do not message me about it. Google is 10000x more useful**
**than i'll ever be.**

# Todo
- Orbwalker always misses on ping change
- Pixelsearch doesn't properly hover over enemies if they are too close
- Pixelsearch RARELY targets something other than champions
- Some exception bugs that are annoying but don't hinder functionality
